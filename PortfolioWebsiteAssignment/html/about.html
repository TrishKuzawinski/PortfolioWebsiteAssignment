        <h2>The Infamous Trish</h2>
            <p class="bio">
                Hi, my name is Patricia Kuzawinski; I am a computer programmer student at Georgian College.
                I am currently in my last year of study, and I will be graduating as of 2015. I've recently
                done some work for the provincial government in the mainframe field, but I've also repaired computers
                for my personal clients. I have extensive knowledge on web programming languages such as HTML5, CSS3,
                and PHP. In addition, I also have advanced-level knowledge on mainframe programming languages such as REXX and JCL.
                On my spare time, I like to learn new programming languages and listen to various genres of music.
                My background is Polish, and I have an unhealthy obsession with cats. I love to dabble around with makeup
                and eat cookies all day long. I enjoy reading folklore and fantasy novels. My future is undecided, but I have 
                faith that I will be able to find my true path in life.
            </p>
